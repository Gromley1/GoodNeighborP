Good Neighbor is a mobile friendly web application that was built in collaboration with myself and four other of my developer colleagues during the ADDIHacks Smart Cities and Future of Work Hackathon, the app ended up winning first prize. We built this app using  SQL, .Net C# and React Js. My responsibilities for this project were to implement the google maps api in order to build out the incidents map page which allows users to dynamically add incidents as markers based off a city or geo location. When the markers are clicked they show an infow window with information as well as event handlers to up vote or down vote the incident.  A demonstration off the app can be viewed at https://devpost.com/software/goodneighbor and the code for my portion can be viewed at client/src/pages/incidentMap.js.
